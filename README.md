**Currently working on this issue:**

How to use 2 apollo clients in one app?

see folders apollo and apollo2

Currently only able to query/mutate datapage.js or imagetest.js but not both together

The APOLLO_MUTATION is just using the apollo client provided from the webRootElement.

Trying to set client2 when doing the APOLLO_MUTATION in imagetest.js does not work.
